The following quantum algorithm can be used to calculate the product of two qubits.

The algorithm can be represented by the following quantum circuit.

The qubits in this quantum circuit are in the state |1〉 and |2〉. The qubits can be in any other quantum state, 
but the circuit will only work if the qubits are in the |1〉 and |2〉 states.

The quantum algorithm can be implemented in a computer by using quantum gates to manipulate the state of the qubits.

The first quantum gate is the Hadamard gate, which can be represented by the following equation.

The second quantum gate is the Gaussian gate, which can be represented by the following equation.

The output of the Hadamard gate is |0〉 and the output of the Gaussian gate is |1〉.
